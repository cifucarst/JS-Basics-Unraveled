/*
Expressions:

An expression in JavaScript is any piece of code that produces a value.
It can be as simple as a variable, a literal value, or a more complex operation.
Examples of simple expressions: */
5;           // Numeric literal
"Hello";     // String literal
true;        // Boolean literal
myVariable;  // Variable
2 + 3;       // Addition operation

/*
Statements:

A statement in JavaScript is an instruction that performs an action and may or may not return a value.
Unlike expressions, statements do not always produce a value.
Examples of statements: */

var x = 10;           // Variable declaration
function myFunction() { // Function declaration
  // Function code
}
if (condition) {       // If statement
  // Code if the condition is true
} else {               // Else statement
  // Code if the condition is false
}

/*
In summary, expressions produce values and can be combined to form
more complex expressions, while statements perform actions in the
program and affect its structure or execution flow. In many cases,
JavaScript allows the use of expressions in contexts where statements are expected,
and vice versa, which can sometimes cause confusion in distinguishing between the two concepts.
